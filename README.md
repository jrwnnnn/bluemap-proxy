# BlueMap Reverse Proxy <img src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/docker.svg" style="height:30px; margin-left:10px;">

A lightweight Nginx-based reverse proxy container that forwards requests from a secure HTTPS endpoint to a BlueMap server running over HTTP. This setup enables embedding BlueMapâ€™s web interface inside HTTPS websites without triggering mixed content errors in modern browsers. Ideal for Minecraft server admins who want to display their BlueMap maps securely.
